# Time Series and Neural Networks
The goal of this repository is to share a suite of programs written in Python with TensorFlow 2.x (and soon with PyTorch)
to deal with time series with deep learning techniques.

## Common
[common](./common) folder contains common tools of the suite.

## Forecast
[forecast](./Forecast) folder contains a set of programs to implement forecasting on time series.
